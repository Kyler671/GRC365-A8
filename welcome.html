    <h1>Welcome to Guam!</h1>
    <img src="A8/purple.jpg">
<p><span>A</span>n age of wonders dawned on Guam, 
With the touch of the ancestor! A
time of restlessness and light 
To take the place of peace and night!

Ah, Guam asleep upon the ocean's breast, 
Lulled by the soft Pacific into rest, 
Unending as the sea is and as still. 
Why need you wake to wonders and to ill? 

You are so very little Guam, that you 
Are but a misty speck upon the blue 
Infinity of earth and Guam. 
Although tis well to be of us. 

That is not all of peacef ulness nor rest, 
As you have known them on the gentle breast 
Of your Pacific, where through all the years 
You never knew our world of hopes and fears. 

Ah, dear, delicious, distant, dazzling isle, 
Asleep for ages where those soft skies smile, 
How rude would your awakening be 
Roused by a new world's energy!

Ah, gentle Guam, keep shut those eyes of yours, 
Care not for what is not upon your shores; 
You are so little, Guam away so far, 
The busy world might leave you as you are. 

An age of wonders, sorrows, cares, 
In which each state and nation shares! 
They call it dawn. Guam is such light 
A greater blessing than your night? 

It may be Guam; or if it be or not, 
What harm can be, if only one small spot 
On all the earth is left still unoppressed. 
Where man may stop and breathe and rest? </p>
